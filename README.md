# ModCommon
A small dependency for Mod Developers that does the bare minimum, that can be installed alongside R2API.

The entire feature list:
 - Sets the isModded flag for RoR2Application
 - Adds mods with the inclusion attribute to the network modlist
 - Adds a patch called ILLine that helps mod developers to diagnose errors faster
 - Patch to fix duplication of console messages
 - Very small copy of LanguageAPI since it is the most frequently used
 
That's it.
